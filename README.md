During this assignment i learned how important site navigation is. Site navigation is important because it gives users options to navigate through the page, It tells users what you're offering and the location where it can be found. For example, site search engines uses navigation to figure out your website's ranking, and based on that it changes the site into traffic and conversions.

# Reflection

### Is this site well structured?

When i visit the Footlocker Canada website, the site looks well constructed.

### What could be improved?

Even though the site doesn't look too bad, it needs to be more stable because i noticed it keeps changing a lot. When i started working on this assignment the site was very simple and to the point, however, toward the completion of my assignment the main page added hero section. Another thing that needs improvement is the advertisement of products. I observed that the company tries to sale everything by showcasing it unnecessarily because if there is a filter section, i believe it is redundant to advertise every item in stock.

### What did you learn from studying it's structure?

I learned that its structure is efficient and simple to navigate through it. By using this structure, i was able to get to my destination easily and find the item i wanted.

### Ideas of how you could recreate one of the content types in storyblok

To recreate this structure in storyblok, i would create product page with image, tags, title, category, size, and color, price of items,
CTA component.
